# MorseCodeTranslator
Javascript challenge using JS, HTML and CSS to translate morse code into English and English into morse code.

Both the morse code and English alphabet is stored in an array. Once a person types in a letter or (morse code) symbol into the translator, the translator loops over the array and locates the position of the letter or symbol - it then uses this value to find the respective letter/symbol in the same position in the respective array.
